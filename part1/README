Sample app illustrating how to use the Paperclip plugin.

For a tutorial explaining how this sample app was written, see:
  http://patshaughnessy.net/2009/4/30/paperclip-sample-app

Coming soon: a second sample app showing how to save the uploaded files directly in the database
and not on the server's file system. This will use my modified version of Paperclip that has a
database storage module. See: http://patshaughnessy.net/paperclip-database-storage for more information.
