Sample apps illustrating how to use the Paperclip plugin.

part1: Basic app showing how to upload and display images.
See: http://patshaughnessy.net/2009/4/30/paperclip-sample-app

part2: First app modified to download files through a controller.

Coming soon: a third sample app showing how to save the uploaded files directly in the database
and not on the server's file system. This will use my modified version of Paperclip that has a
database storage module. See: http://patshaughnessy.net/paperclip-database-storage for more information.
